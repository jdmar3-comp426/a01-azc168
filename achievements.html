        Achilles is most well known for his involvement in the Trojan War. Due
        to his near invincibility, he had great success on the battlefield. In
        fact, he was undefeated although the war itself had reached a stalemate.
        On of Achilles key victory's was his defeat of Hector. When the Trojan
        Prince Hector killed Achilles's best friend Patroclus, Achilles vowed to
        take revenge. Thetis asked the divine blacksmith Hephaestus to make a
        sword and shield that would keep him safe. Achilles chased Hector back
        to Troy, slaughtering Trojans all the way. When they got to the city
        walls, Hector tried to reason with his pursuer, but Achilles was not
        interested. He stabbed Hector in the throat, killing him.
