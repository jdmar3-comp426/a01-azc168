        According to myths and stories composed long after the Iliad, Thetis was
        extraordinarily concerned about her baby son’s mortality. She did
        everything she could to make him immortal: She burned him over a fire
        every night, then dressed his wounds with ambrosial ointment; and she
        dunked him into the River Styx, whose waters were said to confer the
        invulnerability of the gods. However, she gripped him tightly by the
        foot as she dipped him into the river–so tightly that the water never
        touched his heel. As a result, Achilles was invulnerable everywhere but
        there.
