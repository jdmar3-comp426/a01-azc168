        Like most mythological heroes, Achilles had a complicated family tree.
        His father was Peleus, the mortal king of the Myrmidonsâ€“a people who,
        according to legend, were extraordinarily fearless and skilled soldiers.
        He was supposedly the most pious man on the planet, worthy enough of a
        divine wife. His mother was Thetis, a sea goddess. When Peleus caught
        her in the act of putting Achilles in the fire, Thetis felt so
        dishonored that she left both her husband and her son and went back to
        live in the sea with her sister Nereids.
